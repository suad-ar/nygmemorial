            <p class="textcontent">Nikita Yaovi Gbordzi was a dedicated son, brother, lover, friend and colleague.
                He was incredibly smart,his wisdom knew no bound. He had a kind heart which manifested in his gentle nature. 
                He was brave with an adventurous soul. He was a trusted confidant, a voice of reason, a guiding light. 
                He was loved by all who were blessed to cross his path even only once.  His physical presence will always 
                be missed but his energy is ever present.
