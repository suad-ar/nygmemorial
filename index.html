            <p class="textcontent"> Nikita is love. 
                "Love is patient, love is kind. He does not envy, He does not boast, He is not proud. He does not dishonor others, He is not self-seeking, 
                He is not easily angered, He keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. He always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
                Nikita persevered. He persevered for excellence throughout his short wonderful time here. From friends to colleagues to clients. Anyone who required excellence from him was not short-changed.
                He was smart, he was witty, he is wise. Nikita possessed wisdom beyond his years. He managed to deliver wisdom with a certain grace that never made you feel inadequate, but with a certainty that 
                left no doubt in your mind about his reasoning or direction. He was our navigator, a role I believe he will continue to play from the heavens.
                Nikita was warmth. Nikita was radiance. Nikita is joy. His heart-filled laughter or even in comforting silence anytime in his presence was time well spent.
                Nikita was fearless. Nikita was brave. Nikita is adventure. He had a thirst for it, so intoxicating that it changed all our lives forever. 
                A brother, a son, an uncle, a lover, our comforter, a dancer, a dj, a Vice President, our convener, a swimmer, a footballer, a tour guide, our provider.
                And there's not a single one of these things he did half-heartedly.
